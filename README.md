Hi — I'm **Ifeanyi**, a hands-on System Administrator and Cloud Support Engineer transitioning toward Site Reliability Engineering. I focus on reliable day-to-day operations (Windows Server, Linux, virtualization, Active Directory, backups, and monitoring) while growing SRE skills through practical projects in observability, incident triage, and automation.

---

## TL;DR — What I bring  

- Operational ownership: systems maintenance, patching, backup and recovery, identity, and support workflows.
- Monitoring & incident triage: experience with Zabbix and operational alerts; runbook authoring in progress.
- Automation: Bash to reduce manual toil and improve consistency.
- Growing SRE capabilities: building SLIs/SLOs, exploring observability tools and IaC through a hands-on end-to-end SRE project.

---

## Key Projects & Impact


- **End-to-end SRE project (in progress)**
  - Building an application lifecycle demo that exercises SDLC → production maintenance: monitoring, simulated failures, incident response runbooks, and basic automation for recovery. This is helping me practice SRE tasks (alert tuning, runbooks, simulated MTTR tracking).

- **[Project Name] — Monitoring & Operational Visibility**
  - Implemented or improved monitoring (Zabbix/Patchmon), documented alert thresholds and runbook steps for common issues. Outcome: clearer triage process and fewer missed incidents.

- **[Project Name] — Automation & Toil Reduction**
  - Automated repetitive sysadmin tasks (user provisioning, backups, patching checks) using Bash/PowerShell. Result: improved consistency and reduced time spent on routine ops.

- **[Project Name] — Infrastructure & Virtualization**
  - Managed virtualization platforms (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, Proxmox), performed host maintenance and capacity planning to keep systems stable and available.

## How I Work — practical ops first 🔧

- Focus on repeatable operations: runbooks, checklists, and clear escalation paths.
- Pragmatic observability: tune alerts for signal, not noise; document triage steps.
- Blameless postmortems and tracked follow-ups for reliability improvements.
- Small, measurable automation efforts that save hours and reduce human error.

## Certifications & Learning

- AWS CloudOps (SysOps) — in progress
- Azure Administrator — in progress
- CNCF: Kubernetes & Cloud Native Associate
- Microsoft: Administering AD DS
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure — Foundation

> Continual learner — I prefer learning by fixing problems and documenting the process.

## Writing & Teaching

I write practical guides and run workshops that help teams bridge theory and practice — monitoring recipes, incident retros, and cloud hardening notes.
